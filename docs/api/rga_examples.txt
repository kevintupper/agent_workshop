Retrieve all comments for a docket where number of comments is less than 5000:

Step 1: Get all documents for the docketId FAA-2018-1084:
https://api.regulations.gov/v4/documents?filter[docketId]=FAA-2018-1084&api_key=DEMO_KEY
It returns two documents, FAA-2018-1084-0001 and FAA-2018-1084-0002. Each document metadata includes an objectId attribute.

Step 2: Get all comments for each document using objectId:
https://api.regulations.gov/v4/comments?filter[commentOnId]=0900006483a6cba3&api_key=DEMO_KEY
The above request returns a list of comments for document FAA-2018-1084-0001.

Note: Step 2 should be repeated for FAA-2018-1084-0002 in the above example.

Retrieve all comments for a docket where number of comments is greater than 5000:

Step 1: Get all documents for the docketId EOIR-2020-0003:
https://api.regulations.gov/v4/documents?filter[docketId]=EOIR-2020-0003&api_key=DEMO_KEY
The above query returns five documents where four documents are Supporting & Related Material documents and one document is a Proposed Rule. Response for the above request includes an attribute objectId for each document and its set to 09000064846eebaf for the Proposed Rule, EOIR-2020-0003-0001.

Step 2: Get all comments for each document using objectId:
https://api.regulations.gov/v4/comments?filter[commentOnId]=09000064846eebaf&api_key=DEMO_KEY
The above request returns a list of comments for document EOIR-2020-0003-0001, the only Proposed Rule in the docket. totalElements under meta attribute shows that this document has total 88,061 comments.

Note: Step 2 should be repeated for each document.

Step 3: Page through the first set of 5000 documents:
https://api.regulations.gov/v4/comments?filter[commentOnId]=09000064846eebaf&page[size]=250&page[number]=N&sort=lastModifiedDate,documentId&api_key=DEMO_KEY
The first 5000 documents can be retrieved using the query above and paging through the results where N is the page number between 1 and 20. Please note we are sorting the results by lastModifiedDate to ensure we can filter our data by lastModifiedDate later. On the last page of this set, please note the lastModifiedDate of the last document. In our case, EOIR-2020-0003-5548 is the last document on page 20 and the lastModifiedDate attribute of the document is 2020-08-10T15:58:52Z. We will be filtering the data in the next step using this date.

Step 4: Page through the next set of 5000 documents:
https://api.regulations.gov/v4/comments?filter[commentOnId]=09000064846eebaf&filter[lastModifiedDate][ge]=2020-08-10 11:58:52&page[size]=250&page[number]=N&sort=lastModifiedDate,documentId&api_key=DEMO_KEY
The next 5000 documents can be retrieved using the query above and paging through the results where N is the page number between 1 and 20.

The lastModifiedDate attribute of the last document in the first set (Step 3) was 2020-08-10T15:58:52Z. This date translates to 2020-08-10 11:58:52 in Eastern time. Running the above query should return all documents where lastModifiedDate is greater than or equal to 2020-08-10T15:58:52Z. Its important to note that we are running a “greater than or equal to” query to ensure we do not miss any documents where last modified date is 2020-08-10T15:58:52Z.

On the last page of this set, please note the lastModifiedDate of the last document and repeat.

Note: Step 4 should be repeated for as many times as needed to retrieve all 88,061 comments.
